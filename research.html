        <p>This page is all about the research that we conducted in order to develop and complete this project.To create this website we faced many difficulties at initally because this was very first time developing webpage using HTMl, CSS and javascript.We had no idea how to start a website.We satrt searching the design from other webpage and got ideas and inspiration for our website.It was lot of fun working in a team co-operating each other idea and decision and learn how to work in team coz it was our first time. Our module teacher help us in that phase where we all are confuse how to start the project but they provide good gaidance and we sucessfully complete our project.We made up our mind and start creating our project So,Here is several websites that we were inspire and they are listed below.</p>  

     <div class="image">
        <div class="img">
            <h1>Nav Bar</h1>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="blank">
                <img src="../images/image16.png"> 
            </a>    
                <img src= "../images/image17.png">
        </div>       
    </div> 
    <div>
        <p>When we examine to the Apple website, which has a beautiful navigation bar and have attractive hover effect, we examined more closely at the navigation bar on the Apple page to get an idea of how it was made. Finally, Doing a intense research As seen on the our webpages, we was able to make good navigation bar with a good hover effect.</p>

    <div class="image">
        <div class="img">
            <h1>Header</h1>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="blank">
                <img src="../images/image18.png"> 
            </a>    
                <img src= "../images/image19.png">
        </div>       
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>We were wondering what else we could put on the home page after adding the navigation bar.After doing some resaerch we make up our mind to put back ground image as put on apple store webpage which was looking pretty on webpage and we done research how it was make after we start doing research and we got the concept of inserting header portion with such backgaround and some text on it and we added one explore buttom on it which was looking good on our webpage</p>

    <div class="image">
            <div class="img">
                <h1>Product page</h1>
                <a href="https://www.daraz.com.np/#hp-official-stores" target="blank">

                    <img src= "../images/image15.png">
            </div>       
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>On the daraz website, we found a fantastic and eye-catching product page that we liked. We have investigated the website and gave it a close inspection. Following that, we had the notion to use HTML tags and CSS for the layout of our product page. Using both internal and external CSS as well as HTML components, we were able to produce an eye catching product page.</p>
